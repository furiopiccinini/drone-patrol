This archive contains the following:

1. model/meta.h5 ; weights.bin - neural network model generated by Neuton in binary format.
2. neuton/neuton.py, neuton/local_prediction.py - .py scripts with the interface for loading of generated network for further usage.
3. predict.py - .py script for obtaining predictions on your file. Usage: python predict.py (--help | <path-to-test-csv-file>)
4. supporting objects/scripts for transforming test data set according to training data set in dict/mods and root folders.
5. output folder is created during prediction script execution, where the predictions on the test data set will be saved.
6. requirements.txt - contains a list of items to be installed using pip install
7. converted_models folder - contains Tensorflow and ONNX formats of the model

Requirements:
1. Before usage predict.py for getting predictions, update the requirements by running the following command:
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

How to use Neuton:
1. Navigate to archive folder
2. From console run the script predict.py by passing path to the file as parameter
   Usage: python predict.py (--help | <path-to-test-csv-file>)
3. Predicted outputs will be saved to output folder in archive

ATTENTION:
The scripts and libraries in this archive take advantage of 64 bit system. In case your environment is situated within 32 bit system, prediction results may vary insignificantly due to bit depth differences.

Integration with Tensorflow, ONNX:
Neuton also offers additional options of integration and interaction with your model. 
This archive provides you with Tensorflow and ONNX formats of the model. 
You can find them in `converted_models` folder.
